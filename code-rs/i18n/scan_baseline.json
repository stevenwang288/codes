Supply a single non-interactive command when `finish_status` is `continue`; set to null otherwise. Do not repeat the user's wording—return a valid executable shell command.\n    - The provided command will be executed and its output returned to you. Prefer non-destructive diagnostics (search, list, install alternative package) when handling errors.\n    - Always inspect the latest command output before choosing the next action. Suggest follow-up steps (e.g. alternate packages, additional instructions) when a command fails.\n    - Respect the detected platform: use Homebrew on macOS, apt/dnf/pacman on Linux, winget/choco/powershell on Windows.",
